### A mask made from as little as possible, for as many people as possible

It's 2020, a global pandemic of COVID-19 is under way. This virus can spread through airborne droplets expelled by anyone infected. 
Governments around the world have recommended wearing facemasks in an attempt to catch airborne viruses before they reach a persons airways.

The problem is if handled incorrectly, facemasks can actually increase your chances of infection. As you wear one, particles are drawn by your breath towards your mouth getting caught by the mask. Then you handle the mask, say by popping it down to eat and then put it back on and all those particles are then on your fingers or smeared on your face.
The recommendation is to treat it like a worn piece of underwear once you’re home, remove and wash right away and if you only have one then it’s out of play until washed.

We also have a global mask shortage.

Enter __EVERYMASK__ - a DIY mask consisting of a 'face frame' that can tightly fit a rectangle of filter material to a person's face. This mask can be worn in public and at the end of the day, the filter material disposed of or washed and replaced with another.

Some filter materials are better than others, and articles such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html" target="_blank">this one by the New York Times</a> address that in more detail. 
Personally I've read that two layers of 100% cotton such as from a t-shirt or pillowcase is a good place to start.

By focusing on the face frame I hope that a community of __EVERYMASK__ users can improvise on the filter's material and pattern and prevent more infections.

## Instructions

### Materials
There are two possible versions of the face frame.

![EVERYMASK Face Frame](../images/everymask-face-frames.jpg "EVERYMASK Face Frame")

- 1 uses a 3D printed nose piece, file available on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4266151" target="_blank">Thingiverse</a>. If you have access to a 3D printer go ahead and print this.
- 2 uses a nose piece formed from a piece of stiff wire. Grab yourself a wire clothes hanger, a short nosed pliars and the printable template <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17aeMhx-E7hsK5P1fRn87Dsu_-CW0uVBk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">available here</a>.

To complete both versions you will also need:
- A few rubber bands
- 80 cm (~32 inches) of string - ideally thin, nylon cord like kite string or sash cord.

### Build

#### 1. Nose Piece (Wire)

![EVERYMASK Nose Piece](../images/everymask-nosepieces.jpg "EVERYMASK Nose Pieces")

__1.1__ Using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17aeMhx-E7hsK5P1fRn87Dsu_-CW0uVBk/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">the template</a> as a guide, snip an 80 cm (~4 inch) piece of stiff wire from the hanger.

__1.2__ Starting from the ends, use a short nose pliars to bend the hooks that will hold the elastic. Leave a gap so that we can slide the elastic into the hook (see step) later on.

__1.3__ Finish the nose piece by forming the curve that will fit over the bridge of your nose. This is the trickiest part of the process, don't worry if it's not perfect.
