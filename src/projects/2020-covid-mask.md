### A mask made from as little as possible for as many as possible

It's 2020, a global pandemic of COVID-19 is under way. This virus can spread through airborne droplets expelled by anyone infected. 
Governments around the world have recommended wearing facemasks in an attempt to catch airborne viruses before they reach a persons airways.

The problem is if handled incorrectly, facemasks can actually increase your chances of infection. As you wear one, particles are drawn by your breath towards your mouth getting caught by the mask. Then you handle the mask, say by popping it down to eat and then put it back on and all those particles are then on your fingers or smeared on your face.
The recommendation is to treat it like a worn piece of underwear once you’re home, remove and wash right away and if you only have one then it’s out of play until washed.

We also have a shortage.

Enter EVERYMASK; a mask consisting of a 'face frame' that can tightly fit a rectangle of filter material to a person's face.

Some filter materials are better than others, and articles such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-homemade-mask-material-DIY-face-mask-ppe.html" target="_blank">this one by the New York Times</a> address that.

By focusing on the face frame I hope that a community of EVERYMASK users can improvise on the filter's material and pattern and prevent more infections.

There are two possible versions of the face frame.
