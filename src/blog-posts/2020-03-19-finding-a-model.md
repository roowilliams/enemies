Like many, I have always struggled to focus and remain focused on one thing. At school I was always placed on a table of my own due to distracting my peers and pulling them away from being taught. Anyone that has a conversation with me will notice I often tend to spin up multiple threads of conversation that we need to jump between to get anything exchanged, all while my eyes dart from one thing to another in the periphery. When writing words with a pen I'll write the following letter before the correct one.

Against my will, this behavior even endangers me. I could be having the most intense argument with my wife, and while doing my best to not disrespect her with a loss of eye contact I have noticed a household problem that needs fixing in the background and my brain has left the conversation to do that.
This trait, while offering some benefits like making me observant, quick to spot problems and offer myriad solutions has deeply affected my ability to function in our modern world. I have joked that if I'd been born a couple of millenniums prior then these skills would have made me an adept survivor and hunter/gatherer. complete tasks of all scales especially when it comes to work and creative output.

On the other hand, I am extremely faddy, and when I happen upon some insight or activity that catches my attention and seems will help me make progress in life, I REALLY go to town on

on projects and fought urges to constantly jump from one thing to another in pursuit of success. I had initially felt freed by a new definition of wanting to become an artist. Finally I was going to be able to work with my creative whims instead of trying to wrangle and control them.

After reading The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield long ago, I had internalized the belief that by sitting down every day to imagine and create smaller things that made me feel something aesthetically, I would be able to get them done and analyze the trail created by these artifacts to discover insights and gain clarity in finding what it is I really want to make. That would provide me the motivation to focus across the lifecycle of bigger and bigger projects, carve a niche and make a name for myself.

I began following abstract artists on Instagram, meeting other artists in my local community and picking their brains to figure out why they do what they do, what constitutes a piece of art and felt encouraged by stories of success they've had in getting people to pay them for pieces. I hoped that my main focus would become art and in a relatively short time I might find my voice and I too, could start producing things that people would be willing to pay for.

I experimented with various techniques: abstract painting scanning painted surfaces and digitally manipulating them to create images. I wondered why I was drawn to this process and questioned continuously why I was interested in creating what I was creating.

I have always been interested in the tension between natural and human made forms, so during that surge of positive activity I had an idea to create a lighting installation using a tree branch.

As I gathered materials I found a round fluorescent bulb, another thing I had always wanted to work with. The fluorescent bulbs needed a ballast which is an electric circuit that charges up to initially spark the bulb with high voltage, before dropping that voltage to sustain a consistent light. So my idea evolved. I was also enjoying the learning.

But as I worked on it, parts started to become tricky and I began to compromise on aesthetics to get it to come together. I realized that it was taking a lot longer than I had hoped the compromises were making me feel disenchanted. The hard edges of reality had began to erode my vision and I questioned what it was I was even making.

Not to leave something half-finished, I kept going despite knowing the quench of finishing a project and standing back with pride wasn't going to happen.

I'm well-aware of this part of a project, Seth Godin refers to it as 'the dip' and historically I'd bet there aren't many great ideas that have avoided this. But there also is a part to this theory that is knowing when to stick at it, and when to quit. With my aim on earning a living from this in a relatively short space of time I began to reassess my projected vision for this endeavor.

I realized that now I within an industry where other artists who have found their voice, and work daily, with plenty of Instagram followers still struggle to pull in an income.

As much of a generalist as I am, I have niche skills that are pretty desirable in our current age. I have a lot of experience in generating ideas to solve design and business problems. I invested years in learning to write code and build things digitally. By running felt pelt at these artistic endeavors I was ignoring all these lucrative skills that set me apart from my peers. By potentially starting again I was moving away from my goal of creating "a venture that can generate a steady and substantial income".

By following this path I would also be doing something less accessible to collaborators. My wife, Lydia, is extremely focused and has a skillset that perfectly compliments mine. Our agreed vision for the future is one where we are able to work together on projects - by focusing on an art career and building a name for myself that way, I would have limited the opportunities for collaboration with her.

## Reframe + Refocus

I've always wanted to build my own business. My focus is now to build on skills I already have to pursue that goal vs start again in a new domain I am not that familiar with, this meant making a couple of decisions about what qualifies as a professional pursuit vs what qualifies as a hobby.

### Profession

I will now be focusing on using my product design skills to build a business. Rather than bouncing between different expressions of creative output I will seek a pain point I and others experience in life, and build a business around solving that problem for people.

### Hobbies

I still enjoy aesthetic

## So what now?

At the start of a new venture I believe in, everything is amazing. My mindset is one of optimism and I enjoy the process of thinking about how I'm going to bring it to life.

Does this make me a maker again? No.
As stated in my original post, I believe a business can become art, and art is uniquely personal.
