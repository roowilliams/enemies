I'm looking for an idea. No wait, I'm looking for a problem. A problem that people have that gets in their way of making progress. One that bothers them so much, they'd be willing to pay for a solution to it - that's a business idea.

One of the best resources I've ever encountered on finding and validating new product ideas is [this podcast](https://podcast.megamaker.co/episodes/037-find-and-validate-good-product-ideas) by [Justin Jackson](https://justinjackson.ca/).

There are so many insightful soundbites in this podcast, but to roughly paraphrase one I find particularly useful:

> We must abandon the idea that customers have ‘needs’ and ‘wants’. They only have one need, to make progress within the systems they interact with.
> The reason customers buy products is because they imagine their lives will be better with them, than without.

The struggles people encounter while trying to make progress within those systems are problems to be solved, ie. potential product opportunities.
Thinking more on this, I realize a system can be anything.
Obviously, as mentioned in the podcast, it could be a system with a location like the New York subway.  
But I think it could also be a hobby, eg. running.

Let's give it a whirl, imagine running was something you knew and enjoyed and so the idea of designing a product to serve runners appealed to you.

What does progress look like for people in the system of running?

> _Desired progress in running:_

> - Getting fitter
> - Running further
> - Running faster
> - Running for longer
> - Looking better
> - Running with others

What are the struggles people might encounter as they try to make progress in one of those areas? Let's pick "running further" as an example and imagine some:

> _Running further struggles:_

> - Not enough time to run the distance you'd like
> - Uncomfortable running sneakers
> - Injuries
> - Safety running on roads
> - Running out of energy
> - Getting thirsty during the run

These hypothesized problems are obviously not researched or rationalized, so it would be dangerous to jump in and start building a business off of these but even from this exercise you can see how identifying the struggles within running could help us create a hypothesis we can use brainstorm and test new product ideas:

> _As a runner I would like a map that shows public water supplies so that I can plan my route around them and run further without getting thirsty_

I had a go at creating a visual model to describe this framework.
