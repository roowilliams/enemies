When beginning the journey into finding my artistic voice, I wanted to start with a goal. I'd love for my output to change something and the change I would love to see is to reconnect people with nature. Why do I say 'reconnect'? Well 'nature' is where we came from.

As I thought about this more, I began to find problems with the word 'nature'.

We all know what 'nature' is, but how is it actually defined by culture? The Cambridge Dictionary describes nature as

> all the animals and plants in the world and all the features, forces, and processes that exist or happen independently of people, such as the weather, the sea, mountains, reproduction, and growth.

Let's think about that for a second...

We were all happy living amongst all the other living things, [probably in forests](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13818682-800-science-early-humans-were-forest-dwellers/) then at some point in human history, someone drew a line around everything that wasn't us, and gave it a label.  
Suddenly, the ecosystem of which we were a part and which we depended on, became separate from ourselves.

This started the process of disconnection. As human tribes formed, nature, including the land and its resources became valuable and protected. Early trading accelerated human effort to fence off new parts of what was free, wild land and society organized around people that specialized in collecting and processing the resources that land had to offer. Now, instead of everyone knowing how to find and harvest food from the land, it came from the basket of a local forager, merchant from another tribe and later, a farm.

By the time capitalism arrived many humans were already living in cities, the center of which were the most developed and aspirational places to inhabit. City living was easy - food and resources were bought at markets so being out and away from the dirt of undeveloped living was something to strive for. We actively wanted to lose touch with the system that propped us up.

Don't get me wrong, as I sit here today and type on my Apple Macbook I know we've a lot to thank this process of development for, but it seemingly made us irrational along the way.

Just because another living thing can't speak, does it mean it should be any less respected?

It's not about connecting humans with nature - nature is a word to describe the collective mass of living things that aren't human.

It's about connecting humans with other non-human communities that inhabit our shared planet. These things support our survival here, and in turn, support each other's survival. It's about giving a voice to the other living things here that don't have one. We are so deeply consumed by our own ways of living that we don't notice those anymore. We have created huge, completely man-made environments so we never not look out beyond the edges and acknowledge that once we inhabited the forest amongst every other living thing. At this point we were more deeply connected with the resources that enabled us to thrive, and lived with less wasteful and more grateful mindsets. These days everything is manufactured. We manufacture gratitude. We manufacture our exercise with gyms. We waste without consideration for the effort needed to give us what we have.
